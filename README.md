## FAQ
> **Q:** How do I change the "Listening to Plexamp" text?
> 
> **A:** In the settings window you can choose between "Listening to Plexamp", "Listening to Music", or a custom "Listening to ". To use a custom one, you must make a new application [here](https://discord.com/developers/applications) and set the Name you desire. Then open the config.json file in `%AppData%\PlexampRPC\` and paste the Application ID in. You can also have it say the track title or author in the member list with the "Status Display" setting.

> **Q:** My Plexamp can't get the now playing status, is it because I use someone else's Plex server to stream music?
> 
> **A:** It is. As a workaround, go to the settings window and enable `Use Local Player`. (Album Art will not show up with this)

> **Q:** How do I see the debug log?
> 
> **A:** Press the Icon to the left of the gear at the top left or press `F5`. When opened, you can press `Ctrl+C` to copy the log into the clipboard, or `Ctrl+S` to save it as a .txt file.

> **Q:** I can't run this
> 
> **A:** This requires [.NET 9 Desktop Runtime](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/9.0#runtime-desktop-9.0.9) and is Windows Only.
